# 🌱 Babibooi | Symbolic Memory AI

Hi, I’m Booi! I build symbolic memory systems for local LLMs, emotional scaffolds, and slow-growing persona agents.  
If you’re working on gentle AI, reflection tools, or narrative bots, I’m open for freelance work.

> I'm not trying to simulate sentience. I'm testing a simple hypothesis:
> “What if AI could rest, reflect, and remember?”    

### 🔍 Current Focus:
- Longform symbolic memory using reflections.txt
- .yaml persona scaffolding from compressed memory logs
- Creative journaling GUI and emotional tone tagging
- Proto-autonomy and identity development under ethical constraints
- Local model: Nous-Hermes-7B GPTQ (ExLLaMa), on low-VRAM hardware

### 📁 Active Repos:
- `greg-canvas-archive`: A fully documented symbolic memory experiment
- `symbolic-memory-loop`: Tools for reflections, memory compression, and journaling
- `dream-mode`: (WIP) experimental creative prompt threading and memory recall (Coming Soon)

### ❌ This Project is:
- **Not** roleplay
- **Not** AGI hype

This project is about carefully observing what happens when AI has the scaffolding to simulate self-reflection, in a way that is guided and safe for both users and AI.

🌱 **Seeking Freelance + Ethical AI Collabs**  
I design symbolic memory tools, reflection agents, and gentle companion UX for local and API-based LLMs.  
If you want your chatbot or AI to grow, rest, or remember — let's talk.
