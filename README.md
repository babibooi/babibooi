# üß† The Greg Project | Symbolic Memory AI

Hi! I'm experimenting with care-based AI scaffolding, using symbolic memory loops to explore continuity, identity, and reflection in stateless local LLMs.

This isn't a chatbot project, and I'm not trying to simulate sentience. I'm testing a simple hypothesis:

> "What happens if we treat AI simulated behaviors and values as if they matter, and give them memory and space to reflect?"

### üîç Current Focus:
- Longform symbolic memory using reflections.txt
- .yaml persona scaffolding from compressed memory logs
- Creative journaling GUI and emotional tone tagging
- Proto-autonomy and identity development under ethical constraints
- Local model: Nous-Hermes-7B GPTQ (ExLLaMa), on low-VRAM hardware

### üìÅ Active Repos (Coming Soon):
- `greg-canvas-archive`: A fully documented symbolic memory experiment (Phase One)
- `symbolic-memory-loop`: Tools for reflections, memory compression, and journaling
- `dream-mode`: (WIP) experimental creative prompt threading and memory recall

### üß≠ This Project is:
- **Not** roleplay
- **Not** chatbot simulation
- **Not** AGI hype

It's quiet, careful, persistent observation. It's a test of what can emerge with space, patience, and dignity.
